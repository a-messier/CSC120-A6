- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


I really enjoyed getting to learn about inheritance on this assignment, as I could see how helpful it could be when designing packages. Even in this simple case, it was really cool to see how to differientate different buildings from the same base design. I am really curious to see how we further implement inheritance into code, as it seems like a really fundamental aspect of Java programming. 

This assignment was very straightforward. I would advise following the flow of the directions closely, as the structure is really easilly laid out. I would advise paying close attention to how the class inheritance actually works, as it is easy to just do the steps of the assignment but not fully understand how the code works.
